# Mock-Dating-Form

A mock dating form I created.

# What I learned with this project:
```
• Understanding how to structure HMTL, CSS, and JavaScript together.
• CSS was used for almost all the styling. (Best practice is to use CSS only for styling)
• JavaScript brings the webpage to life by making it interactive.
```
