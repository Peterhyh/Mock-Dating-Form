# Mock-Dating-Form
A mock dating form I created.
# What I learned with this project:
/n•Understanding how to structure HMTL, CSS, and JavaScript together.
/n•CSS was used for almost all the styling. (Best practice is to use CSS only for styling)
/n•JavaScript brings the webpage to life by making it interactive.
